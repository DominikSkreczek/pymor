Release highlights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Model reduction methods for port-Hamiltonian systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The previous release added |PHLTIModel| class for port-Hamiltonian systems.
This release adds three MOR methods for port-Hamiltonian (or passive) systems:

- port-Hamiltonian IRKA (pH-IRKA) `[#1835] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1835>`_,
- positive real balanced truncation (PRBT) `[#1847] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1847>`_, and
- passivity preserving model reduction via spectral factorization `[#2033] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2033>`_.

Additionally, |PHLTIModel| now inherits from |LTIModel|,
supports the :math:`Q` matrix and
adds conversion to the Berlin form `[#1836] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1836>`_.
To enable some solvers for positive real Riccati equations,
the ``S`` parameter was added to Riccati equation solvers `[#1837] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1837>`_.

Loewner reductor

Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#1924] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1924>`_, an error-aware adaptive
trust-region method was added. This method solves an optimization problem :math:`min J(mu), mu in C`.
for a |Model| with an output :math:`J` depending on a box-constrained `mu`.
The main idea of the algorithm can be found in :cite:`YM13`, and an RB application to box-constrained
parameters with possible enlarging of the trust radius in :cite:`KMOSV21`.
This method contrasts itself from a standard trust region (TR) in the computation of the
trust region: standard TR implementations use a metric distance, whereas this function uses an
error estimator obtained from the surrogate. Additionally, the cheap model function
surrogate here is only updated for each outer iteration, not entirely reconstructed.

Visualization

Additional new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Output functionals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#1796] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1796>`_,
two classes, |QuadraticFunctional| and |QuadraticProductFunctional|, are introduced to handle the cases
of bilinear operators such as :math:`A(u, u) = u^T A u` and :math:`A(u, u) = (a(u), b(u))`, respectively.
These can now be used as reducable output functionals. Moreover, the builtin cg-discretizer also supports
a `quadratic` argument for defining bilinear outputs conveniently.

Tolerance argument for system norms
