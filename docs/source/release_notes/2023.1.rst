Release highlights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Model reduction methods for port-Hamiltonian systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `[#1835] pH-IRKA <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1835>`_
- `[#1836] Refactorization of PHLTIModel to inherit from LTIModel and support Q matrix <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1836>`_

- `[#1847] Positive real balanced truncation (PRBT) <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1847>`_
- `[#2033] Passivity preserving model reduction via spectral factorization <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2033>`_

Loewner reductor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `[#1952] Loewner Reductor <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1952>`_

Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#1924] Adaptive Trust Region Algorithm <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1924>`_, an error-aware adaptive
trust-region method was added. This method solves an optimization problem :math:`min J(mu), mu in C`.
for a |Model| with an output :math:`J` depending on a box-constrained `mu`.
The main idea of the algorithm can be found in :cite:`YM13`, and an RB application to box-constrained
parameters with possible enlarging of the trust radius in :cite:`KMOSV21`.
This method contrasts itself from a standard trust region (TR) in the computation of the
trust region: standard TR implementations use a metric distance, whereas this function uses an
error estimator obtained from the surrogate. Additionally, the cheap model function
surrogate here is only updated for each outer iteration, not entirely reconstructed.

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `[#1937] Switch to K3D-based visualizations in Jupyter environments <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1937>`_
- `[#1949] Refactor/improve builtin visualizers <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1949>`_
- `[#1968] Pin version of ipydatawidgets <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1968>`_
- `[#1988] Fixes for the matplotlib and gl colorbars <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1988>`_
- `[#2061] Interactively explore Models using ipywidgets <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2061>`_


Additional new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Output functionals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#1796] Bilinear Functionals for use with output operators <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1796>`_,
two classes, |QuadraticFunctional| and |QuadraticProductFunctional|, are introduced to handle the cases
of bilinear operators such as :math:`A(u, u) = u^T A u` and :math:`A(u, u) = (a(u), b(u))`, respectively.
These can now be used as reducable output functionals. Moreover, the builtin cg-discretizer also supports
a `quadratic` argument for defining bilinear outputs conveniently.

Tolerance argument for system norms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `[#1983] Add tol to hinf_norm and linf_norm <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1983>`_

Time-stepping iterator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `[#2053] Add iterable time stepping <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2053>`_
